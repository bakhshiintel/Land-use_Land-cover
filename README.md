# Land-use_Land-cover
Land cover data documents how much of a region is covered by forests, wetlands, impervious surfaces, agriculture, and other land and water types. Water types include wetlands or open water. Land use shows how people use the landscape â€“ whether for development, conservation, or mixed uses.
